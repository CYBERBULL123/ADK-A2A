# ADK & A2A Learning Project

A comprehensive learning project for Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols. This project provides hands-on experience with building, deploying, and orchestrating sophisticated AI agents.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **ADK Fundamentals**: Understanding agent architecture, tools, and deployment
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Building and orchestrating complex agent hierarchies
- **A2A Protocol**: Implementing agent-to-agent communication
- **Tool Integration**: Creating custom tools and integrating external APIs
- **Evaluation & Testing**: Comprehensive agent testing and evaluation strategies
- **Deployment**: Containerization and cloud deployment strategies
